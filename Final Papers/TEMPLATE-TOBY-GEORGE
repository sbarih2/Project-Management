# Connections: 
Connecting Immigrant Communities with the World 

Toby George, FALL 2023

## Abstract 

Immigrant communities migrating to the United States often give up their traditions and cultures to assimilate into American culture. Connections seeks to be an online library platform for people to record and archive their cultural traditions from food recipes, prayers, clothing, artisan works, healthcare, and other traditions. Additionally, Connections offers people the chance to explore the different cultures that exist in their towns. 

## Introduction

Although the U.S. consists of one of the most diverse populations across the globe, attitudes towards immigrants are not the most accepting. Many minority communities experience similar stories of ethnic/racial discrimination that negatively affect mental health, which is an added burden to particular immigrants like crisis migrants or asylum seekers who already suffer from significant trauma. At the state-level, especially in states like Texas and Arizona, anti-immigrant policies are creating a context for discrimination for Latino/a persons. (Lebrón, 2023) In rural areas, smaller cities and suburbs alike, immigrant communities and families may feel pressure to conform to American values and traditions, forgoing certain elements of their culture. This process of acculturation can create forms of crisis and trauma for immigrant families and future generations. Already, many of these immigrant communities are fleeing stressful situations in their home country.(Foote, 2023) Social isolation can be a dangerous situation. Some choose to give up their cultural traditions to ensure that their neighbors accept them and reduce the chances of disputes and disagreements. This should never be the case. People should be able to share and embrace their cultures freely. Preserving cultural heritage is crucial for maintaining identity, fostering a sense of belonging, and promoting diversity within communities. By documenting traditions such as food recipes, clothing styles, prayers, healthcare practices, and artisan works, Connections helps in safeguarding these invaluable elements from being lost due to acculturation. But what if we can learn about the cultures that exist in our communities? What if we could document and archive the traditions to teach others about our culture? Or so our future generations could understand more about the cultures that existed and molded our society? 

## Vision

Connections seeks to be an open-source applications library where people can share and document information on their cultural traditions. We aim to create an online platform for people to learn about the differing cultures that exist in their community. 



## Principles

### Community Building 

This platform relies on local cultural groups uploading information onto the online platform. Community building is the cornerstone of this platform. Highlighting the significance of community involvement, Connections prioritizes partnerships with local cultural groups, educational institutions like high schools and universities, and public spaces like libraries. These partnerships are instrumental in gathering authentic information, ensuring accessibility, and tailoring the platform to meet the diverse needs of users. I envision starting in smaller cities like Champaign. Champaign is home to a diverse range of immigrant communities that would allow us to develop and prototype the platform. The project should work closely with two immigrant groups to archive and document information about their culture. We would experiment with developing a base library that consists of videos, documents and audio recordings. More importantly with this platform, we would collaborate with local community groups, particularly a highschool or university group. We want to understand how we can make the learning experience for someone who wants to learn about the community better. The iSchool and the School of Social Work would be excellent groups to collaborate with to help us better understand how we can make the information accessible, easy to navigate and how it educates someone on the culture around them. 

Libraries and Community spaces are critical to advancing this app into the community. These spaces contain our target audience: people who want to engage with the community. Partnering with libraries and community centers would help us to promote the platform and ensure accessibility to a wider audience. Moreover, with the spaces these buildings provide, Connections would seek to host events or workshops in these spaces to gather input and educate the community about the platform's purpose and benefits. 

### Open User 

Connections aims to develop a user-centric experience by focusing on local hubs rather than a global approach. Users will have the ability to search for their specific town or county within the app, facilitating the discovery of nearby immigrant communities. By integrating location-based search functionalities and interactive maps, users can visually explore and learn about diverse cultures in their immediate vicinity. Each immigrant community will have a dedicated profile page, enriched with multimedia content, showcasing their traditions, history, and cultural contributions. To encourage engagement, the platform will feature community forums for discussions and a review system for users to share their experiences and insights. Considering the localized platform, installing personalized notifications about updates and events related to followed communities will ensure a dynamic and informed user experience. The platform aims to host events with the library and other community centers. Having this notification and upcoming events sections will be useful to helping people engage with the community. 

### Registered users 

The Connections platform seeks to utilize a user registration and authentication system. This process is designed to be user-friendly yet secure, requiring essential information while upholding stringent data protection measures. Once users complete registration and authentication, they gain access to an array of features enabling them to enrich the local library with their cultural insights. It is important to safeguard against misinformation about communities. User registration, guidelines and moderators would ensure that content is being truthful, and respectful. Clear submission guidelines ensure accuracy and cultural sensitivity, supplemented by a robust moderation system that reviews contributed content before publication. Authenticated users are granted the privilege to upload diverse multimedia formats, such as videos, images, audio recordings, and documents, each subject to tagging and categorization for streamlined navigation. Moreover, the platform fosters community engagement through interactive features, like comment sections and discussion threads linked to contributions, facilitating dialogue and collaboration among users. Alongside the protection of information, we want to prioritize user privacy, offering over content visibility and permission settings. This inclusive environment encourages feedback, providing users with avenues to voice suggestions and concerns, while also recognizing and attributing contributors for their valuable additions to the platform. 

### Road Maps

Utilizing Road amps helps us develop a milestone of how the app will change and evolve over time as well as helping communities develop relations with the world around them
Utilizing roadmaps in our app development process serves as a pivotal tool in envisioning the evolution and transformation of the platform over time across various local hubs. These roadmaps function as comprehensive guides, delineating milestones and significant developmental phases that the app will traverse as it is replicated in different towns. They chart the course of community engagement, library building, and app development. By delineating clear milestones, roadmaps enable us to visualize the app's progression, ensuring it aligns with the evolving needs and expectations of different local hubs. Moreover, these roadmaps act as a bridge, fostering relationships between diverse cultural communities and the wider society. As the app evolves, it becomes a repository not just of cultural information but also a conduit for fostering mutual understanding and appreciation among various communities. 

### Project Boards 

Utilizing project boards, such as the one available on GitHub, plays a pivotal role in guiding our app development journey. These boards act as centralized hubs where our team outlines objectives, tracks progress, and identifies potential hurdles encountered during the app's development phases. By leveraging these project boards, we gain a clearer understanding of our objectives and streamline our focus towards achieving these milestones. Considering that there are various hubs, it is important that software engineers, UI designers and others alike are able to understand the different needs of the community. Additionally, they serve as repositories of issues encountered, allowing for meticulous tracking and resolution of challenges throughout the development process. Continuous feedback mechanisms integrated into these boards play a crucial role in driving iterative improvements. This fosters a responsive approach, ensuring that the platform remains adaptive to evolving user needs and preferences. Furthermore, these boards enable us to maintain a user-centric approach, nurturing a deeper understanding and appreciation of local cultures by constantly refining the platform to better serve diverse communities. Ultimately, the project boards act as dynamic tools that facilitate collaborative problem-solving, enhance transparency, and steer our development efforts towards creating a more inclusive and enriched platform.
